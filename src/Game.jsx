// Note that you are removing the export default keywords before the function Board() { declaration and adding them before the function Game() { declaration. This tells your index.js file to use the Game component as the top-level component instead of your Board component. The additional divs returned by the Game component are making room for the game information youâ€™ll add to the board later.
